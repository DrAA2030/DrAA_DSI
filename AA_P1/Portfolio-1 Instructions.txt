
Portfolio Builder #1

Focus: Reporting

Stage 1 will take your knowledge of R, Data Visualization and Python into account.
Work on a simple data set:
    * Chicken Weights
    * Diamonds
    * Palmer's Penguins
    * Titanic


The goal here is to showcase your technical skill (GitHub, R, Python, Command Line) and not your nascent analytical skills.
Thus, the data sets used here are very small, clean, easy-to-work-with and well-described.

Deliverable
A GitHub Repository containing:
    1. Either Rmarkdown or ipynb documents (output to HTML!)
    2. An explanatory (readme.md) file for the repo.


Evaluation metrics
* Need-to-haves
    o [ ] Does the GitHub repo exist?
    o [ ] Is the (readme.md) informative?
    o [ ] Is there at least one R or Python example file viewable in HTML?
    o [ ] Were the assigned data sets used?
    o [ ] Were the commands used appropriate and thorough for an EDA?
    o [ ] Is there non-code commentary?
    o [ ] Is the code commented (usingï¿½#)?
    o [ ] Are there apprporiate and useful data visualizations?

* Nice-to-haves
    o [ ] Use of new data sets.
    o [ ] Improvement of plot formatting.
    o [ ] Use of useful plot types discussed in class or the learning material.
    o [ ] Files in both R and Python.
